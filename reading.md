title: Reading List
---

Inspired by the reading lists maintained by [Susan Fowler](https://www.susanjfowler.com/reading-list) and [Julian Schrittwieser](http://www.furidamu.org/books/), I decided to make one for myself.

I am not a voracious reader, but I maintain a big list of bookmarks and books that I want to go through. I hope that making this page will give me some motivation to read some of these good books and long articles. I will also put anything which I find very thought-provoking or interesting [here](/interesting-links/). Books that I am currently reading are marked with [x].

- [x][Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Chris Bishop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf): For my coursework, I have gone through a lot of bits and pieces of this one. For the sake of completion and as an exciting read, I want to cover this one. This is going to take long, and hence will mostly be in parallel with other readings. To maintain some notion of progress, I will keep updating this paragraph with the chapters that I finish instead.
