Goodreads profile [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58133793-mohit-sharma).

Inspired by the reading lists maintained by [Susan Fowler](https://www.susanjfowler.com/reading-list) and [Julian Schrittwieser](http://www.furidamu.org/books/), I decided to make one for myself.

I am not a voracious reader, but I maintain a big list of bookmarks and books that I want to go through. I hope that making this page will give me some motivation to read some of these good books and long articles. I will also put anything which I find very thought-provoking or interesting [here](/interesting-links/). Books that I am currently reading are marked with [x].

### Currently Reading
- Bose and His Statistics, by G. Venkataraman
