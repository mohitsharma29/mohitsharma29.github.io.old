title: 'The Story behind NoisyActions2M: A Multimedia Dataset for Video Understanding from Noisy Labels'
---

Our paper [NoisyActions2M: A Multimedia Dataset for Video Understanding from Noisy Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06827) has been accepted as a short paper at ACM MM Asia 2021. While this paper may count little towards my PhD thesis, this has been one of the most transformative projects I have ever undertaken; learning a wide array of things, tasting some bitter fruits, learning how to manage a large scale research project and overall shifting my areas of interest altogether. Over the next few sections, I will try and dictate the evolution of this project and will highlight some personal lessons I learnt during that time. I will also use this opportunity to talk about this work and how this work might evolve in the future.

## Beginnings

The project started when I was still an Research Assistant with Dr. Rajiv, my advisor. I wanted to move away from the usual projects I work on and requested my advisor to link me with some collaborator for an interesting project. He introduced to Dr. Yogesh, and we started figuring out that we should work on addressing learning from noisy large scale web data, especially which is multi-labeled. Very soon, I converted to a PhD student and some portion of my time now went towards coursework.
