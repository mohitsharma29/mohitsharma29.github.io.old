title: Coursework and Teaching

Here is a list of courses that I have taken during my Ph.D. and the ones for which I was a Teaching Assistant. It also lists some online classes that I take on the side. I like taking rigorous courses. Not only it helps with my Ph.D. research objectives, but it also provides me with more tools to think about and introduces me to useful and important problems in related fields. I also firmly believe that to be a successful researcher, one should have a sound understanding of things that are even remotely related to their field.
