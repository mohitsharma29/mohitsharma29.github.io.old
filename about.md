I am a Ph.D. Scholar at [IIIT Delhi](https://iiitd.ac.in/). Starting July 2021, I will be a joint Ph.D. scholar with Microsoft Research India, supervised by [Dr. Amit Deshpande](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/amitdesh/). At IIIT Delhi, I work with [Dr. Rajiv Ratn Shah](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/team/rajiv-ratn-shah.html) at [MIDAS Lab](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/). I received my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from [BML Munjal University](https://www.bmu.edu.in/). 

I currently work with large-scale noisy multi-labeled data and methods to efficiently learn from such data. I also work with fairness. In a not-so-distant past, I worked with Speech Recognition and Emotion Detection. Please have a look at my publications for more details. In my spare time, I catch up on subjects I like and play PC games. I also run the [ML Reading Group](https://github.com/mohitsharma29/ML-Reading-Group). 

I love sports and actively play Cricket, Table Tennis, and Badminton. I am active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mohitsharmaj29).

Please get in touch if you want to collaborate with me on some interesting research opportunities. My email ID is mohits [at] iiitd [dot] ac [dot] in.
