I am a Ph.D. Scholar at [IIIT Delhi](https://iiitd.ac.in/) supervised by [Dr. Rajiv Ratn Shah](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/team/rajiv-ratn-shah.html) at [MIDAS Lab](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/) and a joint Ph.D. candidate with Microsoft Research India, supervised by [Dr. Amit Deshpande](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/amitdesh/). I received my B. Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from [BML Munjal University](https://www.bmu.edu.in/). 

I currently work on Fairness in Generative Models and in the presence of Distribution Shifts. Earlier, I worked with [large-scale noisy multi-labeled data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06827) and methods to efficiently learn from such data. In a not-so-distant past, I have worked with [Speech Recognition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/8910138/8919254/08919271.pdf), [Emotion Detection](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-1216-2_10) and dabbled a little bit into [Fake News Detection](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/7230/7084) and [Community Detection](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/7148/7002). Please have a look at my publications for more details. I catch up on subjects I like and play PC games in my spare time.  

I love sports and actively play Cricket, Table Tennis, and Badminton. I am active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mohitsharmaj29).

Please get in touch if you want to collaborate with me on some interesting research opportunities. My email ID is mohits [at] iiitd [dot] ac [dot] in.
